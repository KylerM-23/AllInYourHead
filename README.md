This project was orginally made when I was in High School for my AP Computer Science Principles exam.

In this python file, executing main.py will begin the game which was made with multiple modules which can be found in the main.py file. All code not from the modules grahpics.py, winsound and others as such were not created by me and are the work of those who made them. Everything else was made by myself. The game is the basework for an turn based RPG which and only goes as far as the first day in the game.
